Tech Data Sheets

This project contains the code used to generate technical data sheets and leed letters. The XML files are sample files only. 
You will need to read through the XML and the code to full understand how to create the necessary production XML files for your
application.

You can have multiple products specified in each XML file. Some modifications to the code may be required to get the desired
filename associated with the output of the process.

Good luck!
